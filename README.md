## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[This Challenge from Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/newsletter-signup-form-with-success-message-3FC1AZbNrv) 

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this newsletter form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I used NextJS to complete the challenge.

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Getting Started ðŸš€

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
